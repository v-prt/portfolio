            where my teammates and I built a web application using React, Redux, Node, and Express
            for a fictional company we dubbed "eagleTek".

            Users can create an account, browse a large database of wearable tech such as smart
            watches and fitness trackers, and interact with their cart by adding or removing
            products and viewing their total purchase price. Products are sorted categorically as

            As team lead for this project, it was an interesting challenge to divide our tasks based
            on our strengths while keeping the design cohesive! I helped us stay on track by
            organizing our project kanban board on GitHub and arranging our daily meetings.
