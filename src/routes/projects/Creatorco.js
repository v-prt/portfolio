            Rebranding and redesign of the Creator.co website (homepage, landing pages, and key
            components such as the header and footer). We wanted to have a more modern and fresh
            aesthetic and user-friendly layout that would help brands and creators find the
            information they need about our platform more easily.

            This is one of my favorite types of projects in which I got to work deeply on the
            structure and design of the website, and push my limits as a frontend developer. I
            followed mockups provided by an external designer to completely rework the homepage and
            main landing pages.

            For this project, I had an especially tight deadline due to an upcoming conference but I
            worked quickly and efficiently to get it done in time - within 2 weeks from handoff! I
            focused on the structure and responsiveness first, then worked my way up to the more
            advanced but less important aspects of the update (such as animations). None of the
            animations were provided in the mockups and the implementation was left up to me,
            including the layered images that fade in and out and cards that slide into view as you
            scroll.
