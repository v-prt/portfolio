            Houseplants are a fairly new obsession of mine and sometimes I struggle to remember
            their various needs! My solution had been to keep a spreadsheet with information on each
            plant, such as the level of light, water, temperature, and humidity they each required.

          <div className='mockups'>

            I decided to design and build
            <strong> plantgeek </strong>
            as an upgrade to my spreadsheet, where you can browse and view care information for a
            large database of houseplants. Users can create an account, edit their profile, and
            curate lists of plants they own or wish to have. They can also contribute to the
            platform by submitting new plant images and information. Admins can approve or reject
            submissions, as well as edit and delete plants. Approved submissions earn users cute
            stickers which are showcased on their profiles!

            I started this website as a full stack solo project in 2021 and continued to maintain
            and improve on it in my spare time through 2022. Watch the demo video (link below) or
            look through my code on GitHub! The platform is fully responsive and usable on desktop,
            tablet, and mobile. I also created a{' '}
            <Link to='/projects/plantgeek-app'>mobile app version</Link> on React Native.
