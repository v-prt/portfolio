            Houseplants are a fairly new obsession of mine and sometimes I struggle to remember
            their various needs! My solution had been to keep a spreadsheet with information on each
            plant, such as the level of light, water, temperature, and humidity they each required.

            I decided to build
            <strong> plantgeek </strong>
            as an upgrade to my spreadsheet, where you can browse and view care information for a
            large database of houseplants. Users can create an account, edit their profile, and
            curate lists of plants they own, love, or wish to have. They can also contribute to the
            database by submitting new plant images and information. Admins can approve or reject
            submissions, as well as delete plants. Approved submissions earn users cute stickers
            which are showcased on their profiles.

            I started this website as a full-stack solo school project in 2021 and I have
            periodically continued to improve on it in my spare time. While not technically open to
            the public, the website is live and usable to anyone who wishes to try it out - feel
            free to look through my code on GitHub as well!
