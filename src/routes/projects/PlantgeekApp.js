            Introducing my latest project, a mobile app built using React Native that is perfect for
            plant lovers! With this app, users can easily browse and add plants to their collection
            or wishlist, track their care needs such as watering and fertilizing, and even upload
            new plants using their phones.

            I built this app as a companion to my{' '}
            <a href='https://www.plantgeek.co' target='_blank' rel='noopenner noreferrer'>
              plantgeek
            </a>{' '}
            website, which I created a while back. With my newly acquired React Native skills, I put
            my knowledge to use and developed an app with the same key user flows as the website.
            However, I also added some cool device-specific functionality to make the app even more
            interactive and fun.

            A seemingly small but important feature I included in this app is haptic feedback, which
            highly improves the experience for users (especially for key interactions). As a
            developer, I prioritized creating a smooth UX with a clean and intuitive interface,
            ensuring that users can easily navigate and manage their plant collection.
