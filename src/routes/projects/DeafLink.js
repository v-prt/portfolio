          <p>
            My final project completed for my Google UX Design Certification in which I designed a
            user experience for social good. I chose to solve a problem faced by the{' '}
            <b>deaf community</b> - being disconnected from each other and lacking access to
            resources that could enrich their lives.
          </p>
          <div className='mockups'>

          </div>
          <p>
            My solution to this real world issue was a social media mobile app focused on helping
            deaf or hard-of-hearing people around the world meet and connect through events. I also
            created a complementary responsive website to provide deaf, hard-of-hearing and hearing
            people a central place for finding resources or services such as sign language
            interpreters, ASL guides, deaf-friendly businesses, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to inform my designs, I conducted user research and did a competitive audit on
            other social media apps and websites for the deaf to discover gaps and opportunities for
            improvement. Once I had a clear idea of my user's needs, I started my designs by
            ideating on paper and then proceeded to create digital wireframes and prototypes for
            testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to flesh out the responsive website designs as
            much as I would have liked, so I focused on establishing a clear information
            architecture and site hierarchy which would help propel the rest of the design process
            for the website.

            Ultimately, this project taught me how to consider the use case of the product I'm
            designing - whether it's a mobile app or website and to optimize page layouts and
            navigation to meet different device specifications while keeping the user's needs front
            of mind.
