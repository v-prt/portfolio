            A spin on the classic "Cookie Clicker" browser game which started as a small school
            project and evolved over time as I continued to tinker with the aesthetics and gameplay
            logic. It was a fun way to practice my Javascript skills and learn more about game
            design, which is something I've always been interested in.

            The goal of the game is to make as much sushi as you can, buy upgrades and restaurants,
            and work your way up to owning a franchise. Try it out and have fun - your progress is
            automatically saved so you can always come back to it later!
