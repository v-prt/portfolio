            My second UX Design project in which I designed a responsive website that allows users
            to efficiently order highly customized sweatshirts or hoodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users would be able to browse women's or men's sweatshirts and use filters to narrow
            down their results based on things like size, color, and features. They could also build
            their own sweatshirt or hoodie using the custom sweatshirt builder. Once they've found
            their perfect sweatshirt, they can add it to their cart, proceed through the checkout
            flow, and view their order history.

            I repeated the entire UX design process I learned in my previous project, including
            wireframing and prototyping. This time, however, I used <b>Adobe XD</b> rather than
            Figma in order to learn a new design tool! Personally, I prefer Figma as I find it more
            intuitive but I'm glad to have become familiar with Adobe XD as it is such a popular
            tool. It also has some useful features that are lacking in Figma, such as the ability to
            quickly and easily repeat a grid of elements.
