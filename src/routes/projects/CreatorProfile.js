            This was a major project I undertook at Creator.co. As project lead, I was responsible
            for the UX/UI design as well as full-stack development of the new Creator Profile, which
            serves as a digital media kit and link in bio for creators (social media influencers) on
            our platform. My teammates were responsible for securing SSLs for the custom subdomains
            as well as crypto wallet connection for NFT verification.

            Features include uploading a profile image, bio and other personal information;
            automatically updated metrics for connected social platforms; automatically populated
            top performing content; and the option to upload recommended products, showcase an NFT
            collection, and custom links - all of which is done through the profile editor in the
            creator's dashboard once they've claimed their profile by verifying their Creator
            Passport NFT ownership.
