            The goal was to provide creators a better alternative to Linktree with exclusive
            features just for our NFT holders. Features include uploading a profile image, bio and
            other personal information; automatically updated metrics for connected social
            platforms; automatically populated top performing content; and the option to add rates
            for social media services, upload recommended products, showcase an NFT collection, and
            add custom links.
